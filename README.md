# Customer Churn Prediction with Machine Learning

## Overview
This project implements an end-to-end machine learning pipeline for predicting customer churn. Using advanced machine learning techniques and a comprehensive dataset, we build and compare multiple models to accurately predict when customers are likely to leave a service.

## 🚀 Key Features
- Complete end-to-end ML pipeline
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Implementation of 5 different ML models
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Interactive web application for model inference
- Comprehensive data visualization
- Integration with Groq for accelerated inference

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python**: Primary programming language
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or XGBoost
- **Groq**: High-performance ML inference
